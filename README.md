- 👋 Hi, I’m @sfrivas (Stephen). I recently moved to the Bay Area. My SW development experience for the past 5 years has been mainly in LabVIEW, with a sprinkle of ASP.NET, C#, and Lua.
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud technologies, web development, sustainable energy, space exploration, and cryptocurrency. But more generally, I'm interested in most topics related to technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and the Django web framework via @CoreyMSchafer's awesome [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything software related where I can apply and grow my skills, and learn new skills.
- 📫 Email me at [stephenfrivas@gmail.com](mailto:stephenfrivas@gmail.com) or check out (my soon to be completed) website, [stephenfrivas.com](http://stephenfrivas.com)
